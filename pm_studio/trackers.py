"""External issue trackers (Jira, Azure DevOps): the synced ticket catalog.

A roadmap change can be linked 1:1 to one ticket in one configured tracker. The link
itself lives on the roadmap item (`tracker_id` + `ticket_key`, see roadmap.py); this
module owns everything *about* the ticket - its type, title, state and URL - and it is
the only place that talks to a tracker's API.

Why the split, rather than copying the type onto the roadmap item: the type is the
tracker's fact, not ours. Denormalising it would mean every sync had to rewrite every
linked item and a missed write would leave a card claiming "Bug" for something long since
converted to a Story. Instead the item stores only the link, this store holds one entry
per ticket, and the join happens at read time (server.py's `_with_ticket`). One sync
updates one place.

Three deliberate properties:

- **The network is a seam, not a scattering.** Every HTTP call goes through the module
  level `_request`, which tests replace. No test needs a live Jira.
- **A sync never raises at the caller.** Each tracker's outcome - ok, or an error string -
  is recorded in its own status entry and surfaced in the UI. A tracker being down must
  not take out the roadmap board, which is useful without it.
- **Tokens never leave this module.** They go into an Authorization header and nowhere
  else: not into the catalog, not into a status entry, not into an error message. See
  `_scrub`, which is applied to every error before it is stored.

One write exists, and it is deliberately the only one: PUSH creates a ticket for work
planned here (`JiraClient.create_issue` / `TrackerStore.push_ticket`). Everything else in
this module still only reads, so a tracker's state is its own - a push hands a change to
the tracker once and never edits, transitions or deletes anything afterwards. It is
opt-in per tracker via `[trackers.push]` (see config.PushConfig), so a deployment with a
read-only sync token behaves exactly as it did before push existed.

        Two kinds of ticket are withheld, both because they are not choices:

        - **Already linked** (`exclude`, the set of `(tracker_id, normalized key)` backing
          a change or a project). One ticket backs one thing.
        - **Resolved won't-do.** A decision NOT to build. The import passes already refuse
          these; offering one for a human to link by hand would put declined work back on
          the board through the other door. Deliberately NOT dropped from the catalog,
          which stays the complete record: the removal pass reads it to notice a ticket
          declined AFTER it was imported, and treats absence as unknown rather than
          declined - purge them and that pass goes quietly blind.

        Both filters run BEFORE the limit, which is the whole point. On a mature board most
        of the catalog is already linked or resolved - four in five is normal - so limiting
        first and filtering after would spend a fifty-row page to show ten real candidates.

        Both counts are reported rather than swallowed, because a search that quietly
        returns two rows out of eleven matches reads as a broken search. A caller that
        wants a declined ticket anyway can still paste its key: this governs what is

        The write half of this module, and the mirror of ensure_ticket: that one takes a
        key a human supplied and makes the catalog hold it, this one makes the tracker
        hold a ticket and then does the same. The caller links the returned key.

        After the create the new issue is read back with fetch_one, so the catalog entry
        carries the tracker's OWN facts - the type as its workflow names it, its opening
        status, its real URL - rather than an echo of what we asked for. If that read
        fails (a permission that allows create but not read, or the issue not yet
        visible to search) the entry is synthesized from the create instead: same key,
        the type we asked for, an empty state. Every field of that fallback is something
        we know to be true, and an empty state renders as no state rather than a guess.
        Losing the key here would strand a real ticket with nothing pointing at it, so
