"""Who is doing the work: the people directory and the derived load view.

Jira and ADO each answer "who is on this ticket" in their own vocabulary - Jira with an
account id and a display name, ADO with a `uniqueName` and a display name - and the same
human is routinely both. This module owns the reconciliation: one `Person` per human,
holding every tracker identity that resolves to them, so "what is Dana working on" is one
question rather than one question per tracker.

Four properties it is deliberately built for:

- **The import creates the roster; nobody types it in.** A sync that sees an assignee no
  identity claims creates that person (see `PeopleStore.reconcile`). A directory somebody
  has to populate by hand is a directory that is stale within a week, and the trackers
  already know who is working on what.
- **A person is not an account.** Most assignees will never sign in here. `Person` is a
  name to attribute work to; `account_id` optionally links one to an `accounts.User`, which
  is what lets the costing roster's capacity and rate apply to the same human. The two are
  separate on purpose: requiring an invite before somebody's work could be shown would make
  the board lie about who is doing it.
- **Assignment made here never reaches the tracker.** A linked change's assignee is the
  tracker's fact, joined at read time like its type and state; a local `assignee` on the
  change is this deployment's own planning decision, and where the two disagree BOTH are
  reported (see `effective_assignee`). Nothing in this module writes to a tracker - the
  only write pm_studio makes is `trackers.TrackerStore.push_ticket`.
- **Load is derived, never stored.** `workload` counts open changes out of whatever the
  board says right now. A stored per-person total would be wrong the moment somebody moved
  a card, and a load figure that is wrong is worse than no load figure, because it gets
  used to hand somebody their next piece of work.
