# falls back to HEURISTIC caching: it reuses a subresource for a fraction of its age
# WITHOUT revalidating. A page is a navigation and gets revalidated; nav.js is a
# subresource and does not - so an upgrade could pair a freshly-fetched page with a
# stale nav.js from cache. That combination is not merely cosmetic: a page calling a
# `window.PMNav` API the cached nav.js predates throws during its inline script and
# renders NOTHING AT ALL - an empty board under a working nav bar.
#
# Every asset here is served from disk and carries no version in its URL, so there is
# nothing to cache-bust with and the only safe answer is to revalidate. Note that a bare
# FileResponse does not implement conditional requests (that lives in StaticFiles, which
# this deliberately isn't), so revalidation re-sends the body rather than 304-ing. That

    plus the one-time cleanup a deployment that predates the link needs.

    Dedupe comes FIRST, because most deployments already created their projects by hand
    while mirroring the tracker's epics - importing blindly would twin every one of
    them. So, per routing tracker, three idempotent steps:

    1. LINK by evidence: an unlinked project whose linked changes' tickets all parent
       to ONE epic already is that epic locally - link the two rather than creating a
       twin. This is the hierarchy argument run in reverse: a change's parent epic
       should be its project, so a project's changes point back at its epic.
    2. LINK by title: an unlinked project titled exactly like exactly one epic (and no
       other unlinked project competing for that title) is linked too - the fallback
       for projects whose changes aren't ticket-linked yet.
    3. CREATE the rest: a routed, still-open epic nobody holds becomes a new linked
       project. It lands unaligned - which initiative an epic serves is a human call,
       and the unaligned report is the existing place that call is requested.

    Before any of that, the pass RECLAIMS its own mess: a deployment whose
    import_types included the epic rung had every epic imported as a CHANGE before
    projects could link, and each of those changes now blocks its epic from backing a
    project. One is deleted only when it is provably still the import artifact and
    nothing more - the description is exactly the stamp the import wrote, no project,
    no owner - so the only thing removed is a duplicate of the epic this pass is about
    to represent properly. A change anyone touched is somebody's work and stays put.

    Anything else is counted, not guessed: an epic held by a change someone touched
    (unlink it there to let it become a project), an unrouted one, a won't-do one
    (declined, not a plan), a done-category one (history, not a plan), and any project

    Re-parenting a story in the tracker is a deliberate act, and a more recent one than

    - A project linked to an epic in THIS tracker: the tracker put the change there, so
      the tracker may move it. This is what makes re-parenting upstream replicate onto
      the board instead of stranding the change under its old epic forever.
    - A project with no epic link, or one linked to a DIFFERENT tracker: a human filed
      it there by hand, against the hierarchy. That outranks the tracker and is counted
      (`reparent_kept`) rather than overridden - the board must not fight its own users.

    The one thing the board does NOT get to disagree with the tracker about. `bucket` is
    the plan and stays untouched - now/next/later is this deployment's call, and nothing
    here ever moves a card between columns. But status is a claim about EXECUTION, and
    for work that has a ticket the tracker is the system that actually knows: a change
    reading "in progress" against a closed ticket is not a plan, it is a stale snapshot.
    Before this pass existed, `_imported_status` ran once at import and never again, so
    every linked change froze at whatever state its ticket had on the day it landed.

    Both directions, deliberately. A ticket reopened after it was imported drags its
    change back out of done, because "done" here was only ever a reading of the ticket -
    `roadmap_store.create` stamps `shipped_at` from the clock at IMPORT time, so there
    is no real ship date to protect.

    Three kinds of ticket are left alone, each for a reason the other passes share:

    - ABSENT from the catalog: unknown, not "not done" (it may simply have aged out of
      `since`). Mirroring on absence would reopen the whole board the first time a sync
      came back short - the same posture _remove_wont_do_imports takes.
    - WON'T-DO: declined is not shipped. Its Done category maps to "done", so mirroring
      would quietly relabel abandoned work as delivered - exactly what the import
      refuses to do. The removal pass above has already deleted the untouched ones and
      counted the rest (`wont_do_kept`); the survivors keep the status a human gave them.
    - EXCLUDED: this slice is tracked authoritatively elsewhere, and exclusion means
      invisible to every automatic pass, status included.

    Unlike every other pass here this one does NOT skip a tracker that imports nothing.
    `imports` gates whether a tracker MANUFACTURES changes; this pass only keeps changes
    that already exist honest, and a ticket somebody linked by hand from a catalog-only
    tracker (no `import_types`, no routes - the shape the ADO instance runs in) has
    exactly the same claim to a current status as one the import created. Gating on
    `imports` here stranded every hand-linked ADO change at its import-day state.

    The counterpart to `_mirror_epic_status` for everything that pass will NOT touch on

    `reason: "tracker"` - the epic itself is done. This is the one the close pass acts on
    when `close_done_epics` is set; reported here too so a deployment running the pass in
    its default report-only mode still sees the row it would have closed.

    `reason: "changes"` - every change under the project is settled and the epic is NOT
    done. Never closed automatically, because an epic still open is a live claim by the
    system that actually runs the work: mostly ADO epics parked in Active, and Jira epics
    nobody transitioned. The board offers the close and a human takes it.

    `blocked` is the reason neither is offered, and it is the one that matters most:
    every LOCAL change may be done while the epic still has open children in the catalog
    that were never imported - a partially routed epic reads as finished from here and is
    not. Naming the count is what stops the board from claiming otherwise.

    Recomputed per board load like `_project_activity`, and its indexes are built ONCE
    rather than asked of the stores per project: `list_by_project` walks every board to
    answer for one project, which made a board load quadratic in projects x changes.
    `boards` is the caller's own already-serialized changes where it has them - the board
    endpoint does, and serializing 3500 changes a second time was most of what this cost.

    The project-level counterpart to `_mirror_ticket_status`, and deliberately NOT its
    mirror image. A change's status was only ever a reading of its ticket, so that pass
    follows the tracker in both directions. A project's `closed` is a human act carrying
    a `closed_at`: somebody decided the bet was over, sometimes ahead of an epic nobody
    got round to transitioning. Reopening that on a tracker read would fight the PM every
    sync and lose the date, so the disagreement is REPORTED (`epic_open_on_closed`) and
    the local decision stands - the same posture `_report_stale_excluded_imports` takes
    on a mismatch it refuses to resolve by itself.

    Closing on a done epic can leave open changes beneath it, and does so out loud: a
    closed project still holding outstanding work keeps its place on the board wearing
    its "closed" chip, which is precisely what the fold rule was built to surface (see
    isHistoryRow). `closed_with_open_changes` names it in the cycle it happens rather
    than leaving it to be noticed later.

    Four kinds of project are left alone, each for a reason a sibling pass shares:

    - ABSENT from the catalog: unknown, not done - it may have aged out of `since`.
      Mirroring on absence would close the board the first time a sync came back short.
    - WON'T-DO epic: declined is not delivered. `_remove_wont_do_imports` owns those,
      and the ones it kept are somebody's work - they keep the status a human gave them.
    - EXCLUDED: this slice is tracked authoritatively elsewhere, status included.
    - CATCH-ALL: unplanned work never stops arriving, so `update_project` refuses to
      close it. Skipped here so that refusal is not raised as an error every sync.

    Gated per tracker by `close_done_epics`, default OFF: off, the pass counts what it
    WOULD close (`projects_closable`) and writes nothing, so a deployment sees the list
    before a tracker transition is given the power to close local planning work. Not
    gated on `imports` - like the status mirror this only keeps EXISTING records honest
    rather than manufacturing new ones, and a project hand-linked from a catalog-only

    The exclusion in `_excluded_keys` is a gate on the automatic passes: nothing is
    created, linked or assigned for an excluded ticket. It is not retroactive, and it
    deliberately is not. A component is one dropdown in the tracker, and by the time
    someone sets it the local side may hold a project a human filed under an initiative,
    renamed, and planned around - deleting that on a tracker edit would let a one-field
    change in Jira erase local planning work. So the mismatch is surfaced and the call
    stays with the PM. Contrast `_remove_wont_do_imports`, which does remove: a won't-do
    resolution is a decision not to build the thing at all, and an untouched import of it
    has no defensible reading.

    Both halves land on the import report rather than splitting change-side from
    project-side, because "this slice lives in another tracker now" is ONE fact about
    one component and reads as one line on the board.

    A linked ticket absent from the catalog is not reported: `_excluded_keys` only knows
    the tickets this sync pulled, so an aged-out link is simply unknown, the same posture
    the won't-do pass takes."""
