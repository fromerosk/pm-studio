# Declaration order is display order. Delete or leave empty for a single-product
# repo with unpinned sessions only.
#
# A product can be a SUB-PRODUCT of another by giving it a table with a `parent`
# instead of a plain label. It is a full product either way - its own board, its
# own sessions, its own id in every URL - and the parent's PM sees its roadmap at
# full detail and can write to it. Nest as deep as your org actually is: a
# sub-product can have sub-products of its own.

# A product can also carry METADATA - who owns it, who builds it, where it is in
# its life, and a line of description. All optional, all context rather than
# policy: the PM's prompt names them, the board badges a non-ga stage, nothing
# authorizes or bills against them. `stage` is one of: discovery, development,
# ga (the default), sunset - anything else refuses to boot.

# business-facing thing (a line of business, or an umbrella over the technology
# serving one); a system is code. The two are many-to-many: a product touches
# several systems, and a system serves several products.
#
# Declaring this table turns on attribution: every NEW change must name the one
# system it is contained within, which is what makes its blast radius knowable.
# Leave it out entirely and nothing changes - no attribution, no Systems tab.

# Project Index (read this first)

This is the map of every document in this project. PM agent: read this file at the

before you say anything to the stakeholder about scope, status, or next steps. It tells
you what exists and where - follow the links to whichever doc answers your question,
rather than guessing or telling the stakeholder you're starting from scratch.

## Start here
- **[PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md)** - the current, durable summary of what's
  built, what's decided, what's open. Always read in full on a fresh session. Never
  wiped when the live spec/chat gets reset.

## Repo layout (product sources live at the root)
- (list each product/source directory here with a one-line description)
- **[{local_dir}/]({local_dir}/)** - PM Studio deployment config and local
  instructions for this repo.
- **[docs/](docs/)** - durable reference docs (list each with a one-line hook).

## Live working docs (reset between phases - may be blank right now)
- **[{workspace_rel}/current/SPEC.md]({workspace_rel}/current/SPEC.md)** - the
  spec for what's being actively built right now. Absence does not mean no history -
  check PROJECT_STATUS.md first.

## Product roadmap board (live, structured - not a markdown doc)
- Board at `/roadmap` on the running PM Studio server; data in
  `{workspace_rel}/roadmap/<product>.json` (server-owned, not git-tracked).
