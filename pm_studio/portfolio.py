"""The work model above the roadmap: Goals, Initiatives and Projects.

The shape is a single-parent chain with exactly one many-to-many relationship, sitting
on top of the roadmap items that already exist:

    Goals  <->  Initiative  ->  Project  ->  Change
                                              `- belongs to exactly ONE Product

- A **Change** is the existing roadmap item (see roadmap.py). This module adds no new
  concept for it; a change simply gains a single `project_id`.
- A **Project** belongs to exactly one Initiative. `initiative_id = None` is a real,
  reportable state called **unaligned** - allowed, so nobody is blocked mid-work, but
  surfaced so it gets fixed. A project may also be linked 1:1 to the epic-level ticket
  it is tracked as in Jira/ADO (see `link_epic`); unlinked means it was created locally
  and is pending upload to the tracker, which the sync cannot do yet.
- An **Initiative** has many Projects and may serve **several Goals**. That is the only
  many-to-many relationship in the model.

Why single-parent below the initiative: it is what makes cost attribution
unambiguous. Change -> Project -> Initiative is a unique path, so those totals are
exact and additive. **The additive tree stops at Initiative**: because an initiative
can serve several goals, the same spend legitimately contributes to more than one
goal, so goal-level figures overlap and must never be summed into a grand total.
`rollup_paths()` returns that unique path per change, and `goal_ids_for_initiative()`
is deliberately separate so a caller cannot accidentally treat goals as additive.

Why Product is not a level: it hangs off the Change, not the tree. That is what gives
the cross-cutting flexibility for free - an initiative spans products because its
projects' changes each carry their own product, and a product appears in many
initiatives for the same reason. No association records needed.

That is also what lets a *session* be scoped to an initiative rather than pinned to one
product (see sessions.Session.initiative_id): the set of products an initiative touches
is derived from its changes, so it can be discovered as the work goes instead of declared
up front. Such a session has no project of its own at first, which is what
`ensure_initiative_catch_all` exists for - see the note there on why its spend gets a
real project rather than being recorded against the initiative directly.

Products are persistent (they come from config). Goals, Initiatives and Projects are
temporary: they open and close, so each carries a lifecycle status.

Storage mirrors roadmap.py and sessions.py: one server-owned JSON file under
`workspace/`, read and written only by the single always-running process, so every
per-session git worktree sees the same portfolio instead of its own drifting copy.
